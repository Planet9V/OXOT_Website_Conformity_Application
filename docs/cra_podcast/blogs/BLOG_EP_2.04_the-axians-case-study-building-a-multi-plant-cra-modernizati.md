## 1. The Commercial Dilemma & Industrial Reality

In European industrial manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and software-defined automation, traditional engineering teams have historically treated cybersecurity as an operational IT concern. Under **Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (The Cyber Resilience Act)**, that assumption is now a catastrophic legal liability.

When we examine the operational, commercial, and engineering reality of `Multi-Plant Engineering Directors`, the central challenge under **Article 21, Annex VII, Recital 34** is clear: how to translate rigorous statutory requirements into defensible engineering architectures, machine-readable Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), and robust supply-chain agreements.

## 2. Statutory Deep Dive: What Article 21, Annex VII, Recital 34 Actually Requires

Under European Union product harmonisation legislation, statutory duties attach directly to economic operators the moment a product with digital elements is placed on the EU single market.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| KEY STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS UNDER ARTICLE 21, ANNEX VII, RECITAL 34                                            |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Essential Baseline  | Secure-by-default configuration, protection against unauthorized data access,|
| (Annex I Part I)    | attack surface minimization, and vulnerability resilience.                  |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Vulnerability SLA   | Mandatory 24-hour Early Warning and 72-hour Full Notification to ENISA and   |
| (Article 14)        | national CSIRTs for actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities.            |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Documentation Duty  | 10-year retention of Annex VII Technical Files and CycloneDX/SPDX SBOMs.   |
| (Article 13)        |                                                                              |

## 3. Recommended Technical Architecture

To satisfy Article 21, Annex VII, Recital 34 without disrupting factory floor operations or inflating bill-of-materials costs, industrial engineering teams should adopt the following reference architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Raw OT Firmware / Application Code"] --> B["Automated CI/CD Build Pipeline"]
    B --> C["CycloneDX SBOM & Cryptographic Hash Generation"]
    C --> D["Cryptographic Code Signing (Hardware Root-of-Trust)"]
    D --> E["Annex VII Technical Dossier Archive (10-Year Retention)"]
    E --> F["CE Nameplate Affixing & Market Deployment"]
    
    subgraph IncidentLoop["Vulnerability Handling Loop (Article 14)"]
        G["Vulnerability Discovered"] --> H["PSIRT Triage (< 24h)"]
        H --> I["ENISA Single Reporting Platform"]
        H --> J["Signed Remediation Patch Delivery"]
    end
    F -.-> G
```

## 4. 4-Step Action Checklist for Engineering Teams

Execute the following four-stage engineering sprint to ensure full audit readiness:

1. **Step 1: Portfolio & Scope Audit** — Identify every active controller, firmware variant, and remote data processing connection governed by Article 21, Annex VII, Recital 34.
2. **Step 2: Supply Chain Risk Allocation** — Embed formal CRA compliance warranty clauses and SBOM delivery obligations into tier-2 component supplier contracts.
3. **Step 3: Technical Dossier & SBOM Verification** — Ensure all firmware builds output validated CycloneDX or SPDX SBOMs stored in an immutable 10-year archive.
4. **Step 4: PSIRT & CSIRT Dispatch Drills** — Conduct a dry-run incident response exercise simulating a 24-hour vulnerability notification to ENISA.
